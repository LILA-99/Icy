The original Icy code, none of Infini-Dev's, WeAmDev's, or Maximus's code. This is all original RipDev
(With a few fixes I made, to make it work again.)

This is Icy, a lightweight DPKG-based installer for the iPhone. It works
on both 2.2.x and 3.x, although it may need some tuning for the latest
firmware versions.

You are free to clone, fork, or pick up and carry this on, if you'd like.
